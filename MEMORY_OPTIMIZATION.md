# Memory Optimization Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Memory Leaks in useEffect

**Problem**: Async operations in useEffect without proper cleanup could cause memory leaks when components unmount.

**Solution**: Added cleanup functions and mounted state checks:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  let isMounted = true;

  const loadData = async () => {
    await fetchData();
    if (!isMounted) return; // Prevent state updates on unmounted component
  };

  loadData();

  return () => {
    isMounted = false; // Cleanup
  };
}, []);
```

### 2. setTimeout Memory Leaks

**Problem**: setTimeout in Newsletter component wasn't cleaned up on unmount.

**Solution**: Used useRef to store timeout ID and cleanup on unmount:

```typescript
const timeoutRef = useRef<number | null>(null);

useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    if (timeoutRef.current) {
      clearTimeout(timeoutRef.current);
    }
  };
}, []);
```

### 3. Unnecessary Re-renders

**Problem**: Functions and calculations were recreated on every render.

**Solution**: Used useCallback and useMemo for expensive operations:

```typescript
// Memoize expensive calculations
const sortedDeals = useMemo(() => {
  return sortDeals(deals, sortBy);
}, [deals, sortBy, sortDeals]);

// Memoize event handlers
const handleSortChange = useCallback((e) => {
  setSortBy(e.target.value);
}, []);
```

### 4. Inefficient Data Fetching

**Problem**: Fetching all deals when only category-specific deals were needed.

**Solution**: Created `fetchDealsByCategory` API function to fetch only required data.

### 5. Unnecessary State

**Problem**: Storing filtered deals in state when they could be computed.

**Solution**: Used useMemo to compute filtered deals from the original data.

## Performance Improvements

1. **Reduced API calls**: Only fetch data that's actually needed
2. **Prevented memory leaks**: Proper cleanup of async operations and timers
3. **Optimized re-renders**: Memoized expensive calculations and callbacks
4. **Better data flow**: Eliminated unnecessary state variables

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Always cleanup async operations** in useEffect
2. **Use useCallback** for functions passed as props
3. **Use useMemo** for expensive calculations
4. **Cleanup timers** on component unmount
5. **Fetch only required data** from APIs
6. **Avoid unnecessary state** when data can be computed

## Monitoring Memory Usage

To monitor memory usage in development:

1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Go to Performance tab
3. Record memory usage while navigating between pages
4. Look for memory leaks (increasing memory usage over time)

## Additional Optimizations to Consider

1. **Implement pagination** for large datasets
2. **Add virtual scrolling** for long lists
3. **Use React.memo** for expensive components
4. **Implement lazy loading** for images
5. **Add service worker** for caching
6. **Use React.lazy** for code splitting
